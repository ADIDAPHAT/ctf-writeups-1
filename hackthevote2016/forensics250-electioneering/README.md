PKZIP file hidden at the end of the poster PNG, contains flag.txt but password protected. Suspicious 44x4 pixel
area in the top left corner of the image. White pixel is 1, nonwhite pixel is 0, converted to 8bit ASCII gives
password `IrateAnagramCakeImage` which can then be used on the embedded .zip, gives flag `flag{4nd_th3_w1nn3r_15...}`
